# Battery Powered Relay Controller

## Description
This Arduino project controls a relay based on a push button. It uses a low-power mode and includes features like battery voltage monitoring and device toggling. The device can switch between different intervals for relay toggling and provides visual feedback via an LED.

## Features
- Battery-powered relay control
- Low battery detection and indication
- Device toggle and frequency change via a button
- Sleep mode for power-saving
